<p> "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
  It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps 
 no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil
 but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, 
 always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."</p>
